        Elizabeth was born in Mayfair, London, during the reign of her paternal
        grandfather, King George V. She was the first child of the Duke and
        Duchess of York (later King George VI and Queen Elizabeth The Queen
        Mother). Her father acceded to the throne in 1936 upon the abdication of
        his brother Edward VIII, making the ten-year-old Princess Elizabeth the
        heir presumptive. She was educated privately at home and began to
        undertake public duties during the Second World War, serving in the
        Auxiliary Territorial Service. In November 1947, she married Philip
        Mountbatten, a former prince of Greece and Denmark, and their marriage
        lasted 73 years until his death in 2021. They had four children:
        Charles, Anne, Andrew, and Edward.

        Elizabeth's only sibling, Princess Margaret, was born in 1930. The two
        princesses were educated at home under the supervision of their mother
        and their governess, Marion Crawford. Lessons concentrated on history,
        language, literature, and music. Crawford published a biography of
        Elizabeth and Margaret's childhood years entitled The Little Princesses
        in 1950, much to the dismay of the royal family. The book describes
        Elizabeth's love of horses and dogs, her orderliness, and her attitude
        of responsibility. Others echoed such observations: Winston Churchill
        described Elizabeth when she was two as "a character. She has an air of
        authority and reflectiveness astonishing in an infant." Her cousin
        Margaret Rhodes described her as "a jolly little girl, but fundamentally
        sensible and well-behaved". Elizabeth's early life was spent primarily
        at the Yorks' residences at 145 Piccadilly (their town house in London)
        and Royal Lodge in Windsor.
