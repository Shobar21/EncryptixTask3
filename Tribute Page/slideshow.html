          <h2>Coronation Ceremony</h2>
          <p>
            On June 2, 1953, Queen Elizabeth II was crowned at Westminster
            Abbey, marking the beginning of her reign as the Queen of the United
            Kingdom and the Commonwealth realms. The coronation was a grand and
            historic event, attended by dignitaries from around the world and
            watched by millions on television, a first for such an event. The
            ceremony followed ancient traditions, including the anointing with
            holy oil and the presentation of the coronation regalia, such as the
            crown, orb, and sceptre. This moment symbolized the continuity and
            stability of the monarchy.

          <h2>Royal Wedding</h2>
          <p>
            On November 20, 1947, Princess Elizabeth married Philip Mountbatten,
            a former prince of Greece and Denmark, at Westminster Abbey. Their
            marriage marked the beginning of a remarkable partnership that would
            last 73 years until Philip's death in 2021. The wedding was a grand
            affair, attended by dignitaries and royal families from around the
            world, and was broadcast to millions via radio, symbolizing hope and
            renewal in the post-war era. Philip was granted the titles Duke of
            Edinburgh, Earl of Merioneth, and Baron Greenwich on the eve of
            their wedding. Together, they had four children: Charles, Anne,
            Andrew, and Edward. Their union was not just a personal bond but
            also a partnership in public service, as Philip supported the Queen
            in her duties throughout her reign.
